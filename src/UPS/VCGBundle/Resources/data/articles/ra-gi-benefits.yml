    <h1>GI Bill benefits</h1>

    <h2>As a Registered Apprentice at UPS, you may be able to apply these hard-earned benefits and take home additional money each month.</h2>
    
    <p>It’s important for all U.S. veterans applying for the Registered Apprenticeship program to understand how they can combine their UPS income with their GI Bill benefits to earn more. It’s also important to know that you can and should apply for your GI Bill benefits early. The process can take months. Fortunately, you can apply for GI Bill benefits while you’re still on active duty. We strongly recommend that you do so. To begin the process, go to <a href="http://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/vonapp">ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/vonapp</a>. Each veteran’s situation is unique, and there are complicated rules and requirements that dictate the exact dollar amount that you’ll receive while participating in the program. The VA, which administers the GI Bill program, will determine the correct amount on an individual basis.</p>
    
    <h3>Brief history</h3>

    <p>The original GI Bill was signed into law in 1944 by President Franklin Roosevelt. In 1947, veterans accounted for 49 percent of college admissions. By the time the original bill ended in 1956, 7.8 million of the 16 million World War II veterans had participated in the program. </p>
    
    <h4>Montgomery GI Bill</h4>

    <p>In 1984, Mississippi Congressman Gillespie V. “Sonny” Montgomery revamped the GI Bill, assuring that the legacy of the original GI Bill lives on, as VA home loan guaranty and education programs continue to work for our newest generation of combat veterans.</p>
    
    <h4>Post-9/11 GI Bill</h4>

    <p>Veterans with active duty on or after Sept. 11, 2001, gained enhanced educational benefits through the GI Bill, including compensation for books and housing costs, and the ability to transfer unused educational benefits to spouses or children.</p>

    <h3>How veterans qualify for tax-free GI Bill benefits</h3>

    <p>Generally, to be eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, you must have served for three years, with at least 90 days of aggregate active duty service after Sept. 10, 2001, or an honorable discharge from active duty for a service-connected disability after serving at least 30 continuous days following Sept. 10, 2001.</p>
    
    <p>Generally, to be eligible for Montgomery GI Bill benefits, you must have been enrolled in that program, have paid $100 a month for 12 months and completed your minimum service obligation.</p>
    
    <h4>Other GI Bill programs</h4>

    <p>Whether you qualify under the Montgomery or Post-9/11 bill, the benefits you receive are tax-free and extended up to a period of 36 months. There are some restrictions, as well as additional versions of the GI Bill, including the Vietnam-era guidelines. In addition, those who serve in the National Guard earn benefits at a different rate. With all these variables at play, it will be impossible for your UPS coordinator to determine a dollar amount when discussing GI Bill benefits with you. Only the VA can determine your individual benefits.</p>
