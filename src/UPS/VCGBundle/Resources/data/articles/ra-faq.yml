    <h2>FAQ Sheet for U.S. Veterans</h2>

    <h3>What is the UPS Registered Apprenticeship program?</h3>

    <p>The UPS Registered Apprenticeship (RA) program is part of a national Department of Labor (DOL) program. These apprenticeships are full-time positions that combine job-related technical instruction with on-the-job experience. They are designed to help millions of qualified individuals find lifelong careers. The UPS RA program offers structured, practical training and a competitive paycheck. Plus, in addition to your UPS pay, if you are a veteran, you may be able to receive extra compensation in the form of a monthly stipend through GI Bill benefits.</p>
    
    <h3>How do I know if I qualify?</h3>

    <p>Apprenticeship positions have requirements just like any job. You’ll go through a standard application and interviewing process to see if your background and skills match the requirements of an available position at UPS.</p>
    
    <h3>What kind of work will I be doing?</h3>

    <p>Currently, we have apprenticeship positions available for the position of driver service provider. As a UPS driver, you’ll learn how to operate our vehicles and make deliveries to businesses or individual customers on tight deadlines. As part of our worldwide fleet providing a friendly greeting and impeccable service, you’ll put a face and a voice to UPS. We’ll be adding additional positions to the apprenticeship program as soon as they are approved.</p>
    
    <h3>Is it a paid apprenticeship?</h3>

    <p>Yes. You’ll start at the same pay at which every UPS driver service provider starts. It’s a pay scale that will increase over time as your experience and skills rise.</p>
    
    <h3>How long does the apprenticeship last?</h3>

    <p>48 months.</p>
    
    <h3>Will I have a full-time job at UPS when the apprenticeship is over?</h3>

    <p>The apprenticeship is available only to employees who have been hired on a full-time basis. We fully expect that you will continue working at UPS after you complete the program, because we’re looking for veterans who are looking for a career. Of course, you’ll be expected to maintain the high standards we set for driver service providers at UPS.Where will I work? Will I have to relocate?</p>
    
    <p>UPS has hundreds of locations throughout the U.S., including every state and every major city. Check <a href="http://www.upsjobs.com/mlitary">UPSjobs.com/military</a> for the locations of current openings.</p>
    
    <h3>How do I apply?</h3>

    <p>Go to <a href="http://www.upsjobs.com/mlitary">UPSjobs.com/military</a> to begin the application process. Once you’re offered a position at UPS, you will complete and sign the DOL Program Registration and Apprenticeship Agreement (ETA-671). You’ll also fill out a few other forms, and UPS management can help you with that. If accepted, you’ll be offered an opportunity to participate in the program.</p>
    
    <h3>Does UPS value my military experience?</h3>

    <p>Absolutely! At UPS, we are extremely committed to helping the men and women of our military find careers. In fact, we have over 25,000 veterans working at UPS, and we’re committed to hiring 50,000 by the end of 2018. Be assured that the skills you have honed while serving your country are a strong match for what we value at UPS. Teamwork. Logistics. Precision. Hustle. A desire to make the world work better. Just to name a few.</p>
    
    <h3>Can my GI Bill benefits be used for the UPS apprenticeship?</h3>

    <p>Yes. Not everyone wants to use their GI Bill benefits to go to college. UPS has made certain that our Registered Apprenticeship program meets all the requirements set out by the DOL and Veterans Affairs (VA) to allow you to use any available GI Bill benefits. The benefits are given in the form of monthly stipends, and they are tax-free. You can learn more about these benefits at <a href="http://benefits.va.gov/gibill">benefits.va.gov/gibill</a>.</p>
    
    <p>How much will my GI Bill benefits pay?</p>
    
    <p>It’s complicated, but generally your GI Bill benefits will last for 36 months, depending on whether or not you have used any benefits before signing up for the UPS RA program. There are other variables as well, including your length of active duty service, whether you are in the Montgomery GI Bill or Post-9/11 GI Bill program, your discharge status and other factors. The only way to know for certain is to apply to the VA. To learn more and apply, visit <a href="http://benefits.va.gov/gibill/apply.asp">benefits.va.gov/gibill/apply.asp</a>.</p>
    
    <p>I already used my GI Bill benefits. Can I still qualify for an apprenticeship?</p>
    
    <p>Yes. Your acceptance into the UPS Registered Apprenticeship program is in no way dependent on your receiving GI Bill benefits.</p>
    
    <h3>If I receive a monthly stipend because of my GI Bill benefits, would that affect the amount I would receive on my UPS paycheck?</h3>

    <p>No, you’d still receive the same paycheck regardless of the stipend.</p>
    
    <h3>How do I apply for my GI Bill benefits?</h3>

    <p>You can start the process before you leave the military, and we highly recommend that you do. Go to the Department of Veterans Affairs ebenefits site (<a href="http://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/homepage">ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/homepage</a>), or complete the VA’s Application for VA Education Benefits (Form 22-1990).</p>
    
    <h3>What will I be required to do once I’m in the program?</h3>

    <p>Just focus on performing your job well and successfully completing your training. If you are using your GI Bill benefits, you’ll submit a monthly form for your hours worked.</p>
    
    <h3>What happens when the apprenticeship is complete?</h3>

    <p>You’ll receive a Certificate of Completion from the DOL, and UPS will notify the DOL and the VA that you have completed the program.</p>
