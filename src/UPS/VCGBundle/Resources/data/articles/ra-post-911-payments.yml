    <h1>GI Bill payment schedules</h1>

    <p>GI Bill payments are higher in the beginning months and gradually decrease. If you’re enrolled in the RA program, this payment schedule works well, because success in the program results in an increasing rate of pay from UPS. In other words, as your GI Bill benefits decrease, your UPS pay increases.</p>

    <p>As you review these sample payment schedules, keep in mind that the details of the GI Bill program can be complex, and the VA will determine benefit levels for each apprentice on an individual basis. The important thing to remember is that the GI Bill program offers you additional income during your apprenticeship. It’s a huge benefit that you have earned through your service to our country. </p>

    <h3>Post-9/11 GI Bill payment rate</h3>

    <p>First, a qualifying rate is established. For the Post-9/11 GI Bill, this rate varies according to where you will be working. Then, over time, you are paid according to this schedule: </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>1st six months</th>
        <th>100% of qualifying rate</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2nd six months</td>
        <td>80%</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3rd six months</td>
        <td>60%</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4th six months</td>
        <td>40%</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Remaining months</td>
        <td>20%</td>

    <h3>Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits sample payment table by location</h3>

    <p>By law, every GI Bill participant under the post-9/11 program receives the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) rate at the E-5 level regardless of their rank while they were in the military. This chart shows dollar amounts for an E-5 that represent the maximum payout level for an apprenticeship program at each location at that rank. (Rates are current as of August 2014.)*</p>
