    <h1>Eligibility to receive Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) benefits is grouped into four basic categories.</h1>

    <h2>Your payments will be determined by meeting one of these four sets of requirements: </h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Category 1: for those who first entered active duty after June 30, 1985.</li>
        <li>Category 2: for those with remaining entitlement under the Vietnam Era GI Bill.</li>
        <li>Category 3: for those who were involuntarily separated for certain reasons or those who were separated under the VSI (Voluntary Separation Incentive) or SSB (Special Separation Benefit) program.</li>
        <li>Category 4: for former Veterans Educational Assistance Program (VEAP) participants who qualify and for a small group of National Guard members who were given a brief opportunity to elect MGIB.</li>
    </ul>
