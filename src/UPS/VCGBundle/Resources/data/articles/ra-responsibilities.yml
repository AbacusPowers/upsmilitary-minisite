    <h1>UPS will work hard to make your apprenticeship as rewarding as possible</h1>

    <h2>We want you to concentrate on your job and your training, so UPS has built a system to make sure the requirements of the Department of Labor and VA are being met, and that all the necessary paperwork is completed and sent in a timely manner. To get the job done, our human resources experts will work with your immediate supervisor to make things go as smoothly for you as possible. Below is a breakdown of our responsibilities.</h2>
    
    <h3>Ongoing responsibilities for the UPS management team</h3>

    <p>Once you are enrolled and on the job, there are a number of things that need to be done to maintain the apprenticeship and comply with VA and DOL requirements. We want to take care of as much of the paperwork and details as possible, so that you can focus on doing a great job and becoming an integral part of the UPS team. UPS will review your ongoing performance and progress with the same expectations as we have for any driver service provider. With regards to ongoing RA program requirements, UPS management will:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Report any status changes to the DOL, VA and UPSâ€™ Global Employee Management System (GEMS)</li>
        <li>Report the following information to the VA: updated employment status, verified hours worked by apprentice</li>
        <li>Complete VA forms for hours, wages and progress reports</li>
        <li>Retain all documents related to training and make them available to the VA for inspection for a period of three years</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Important reminder for employees</h4>

    <p><em>If you are participating in this program and are receiving a GI Bill supplement, you must report your hours every month on VA Form 22-6553d-1 in order to receive your stipend. Submit that form, available on <a href="http://UPSers.com">UPSers.com</a>, to your supervisor monthly. Failure to do so will prevent you from getting the supplement.</em></p>
