    <h1>How to apply for the UPS Registered Apprenticeship program</h1>
    
    <h2>If you are interested in applying, we encourage you to begin the process while you are still on active duty. The process of identifying your GI Bill benefits can take some time, so it’s best to get started early. You can go online to apply to UPS ( <a class="deck-website" href="http:upsjobs.com/military">jobs-ups.com/military</a> ), and contact the VA to learn what GI Bill benefits are available to you, all before being discharged. </h2>

    <h3>Here are the steps you’ll take to become a UPS Registered Apprentice (RA):</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>First, you should visit <a href="http://www.upsjobs.com/military">UPSjobs.com/military</a>, search for an available driver service provider position in a city or part of the country where you are interested in working, and fill out an application.</li>
        <li>Next you should register with the VA at <a href="http://www.ebenefits.va.gov" class="external">ebenefits.va.gov</a>.</li>
        <li>Apply for GI Bill benefits at <a href="http://www.ebenefits.va.gov" class="external">ebenefits.va.gov</a> or by completing the Application for VA Education Benefits (22-1990). When you apply for a position in the Registered Apprenticeship program, you are not required to use your GI Bill benefits. But UPS believes this is a worthwhile use of those benefits, so we want to make sure you are aware of your options.</li>
        <li>Once the VA determines your benefits level, it will respond directly to you with that information. You can know what your GI Bill benefits will be before you are hired.</li>
        <li>You’ll go through the same application and interviewing process as all driver service providers. The background, skill set and personal qualities we look for are often a perfect match for the men and women who have served our country. U.S. veterans thrive at UPS, and we hope you’ll have a long and rewarding career here, too.</li>
        <li>If you receive an offer from us, you’ll be given the opportunity to review the DOL National Standards of Apprenticeship document that covers a lot of the material we’re sharing here with you.</li>
        <li>If you’re going to use your GI Bill benefits, there is some additional paperwork that you’ll complete when you start. You’ll also regularly report the number of hours you work, which is required to maintain your position in the program. Your UPS management team will help you with that.</li>
        <li>Do a great job! We want you to focus on your training and career at UPS. We’re proud that the men and women who serve our country find a home and meaningful work at UPS.</li>
        <li>At the successful completion of your four-year apprenticeship, you’ll receive a Certificate of Completion from the DOL.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Note to current UPS veterans working as driver service providers:</h4>

    The Registered Apprenticeship program and related GI Bill benefits may be available to you as well. Ask your supervisor for more information. The requirements and process for enrolling differ from what is outlined here.</p>
