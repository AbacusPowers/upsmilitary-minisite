    <h1>Begin your career at UPS as a Registered Apprentice</h1>

    <h2>This guide will help you get started with information about the program, the application process and how to obtain your GI Bill benefits.</h2>
    
    <p>At UPS, we have over 30,000 U.S. veterans on our team, and that number continues to grow. In fact, UPS is committed to hiring 50,000 vets by 2018. It’s clear that veterans and UPS share many similar values: integrity, teamwork, accountability and service to others, to name a few. Those qualities make veterans a great fit both for UPS and our Registered Apprenticeship program. </p>

    <p>The program is designed to connect workers searching for skilled, well-paying jobs with employers seeking to build and retain a talented workforce. The United States Department of Labor (DOL) administers the program, working with state apprenticeship agencies to provide opportunities across the country. In 2011 alone, more than 130,000 people in companies across the country became Registered Apprentices.</p>

    <p>As a Registered Apprentice, you’ll gain full-time employment, valuable on-the-job training and experience, with incremental wage increases as your skills develop. </p>

    <p>For U.S. veterans, there is more good news. You can often use your GI Bill benefits with this program. That means in addition to the pay you earn from UPS, you will also receive stipends from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which administers the GI Bill program. And all the GI Bill benefits you receive are tax-free.</p>
    
    <h3>Current available apprenticeship positions</h3>

    <p>Currently, we have apprenticeship opportunities for driver service providers, with plans to add additional apprenticeship positions. The program uses existing training processes and procedures and lasts for a period of four years. Apprentices receive the same graduated pay scale at UPS as all driver service providers.</p>

    <p>These are permanent positions only, and apprentices must be 21 years old for the driver position, be physically able to perform the requirements of the job with or without accommodations, and be able to pass a background check and any screenings required for the position. Ongoing participation in the apprenticeship program requires that drivers meet UPS standards of job performance and successfully complete all training.</p>

    <p>Opportunities for Registered Apprenticeships are available at UPS facilities located throughout the country, in all 50 states and all major cities.</p>

    <h3>Driver service provider job description</h3>

    <p>As mentioned, our first Registered Apprenticeship is for the position of driver service provider. This is a physical, fast-paced, outdoor position that involves continual lifting, lowering and carrying of packages that typically weigh 25–35 pounds and may weigh up to 70 pounds. A Department of Transportation (DOT) physical exam is required. As a driver service provider, you must have excellent customer contact and driving skills, including the ability to operate a vehicle equipped with a standard (manual) transmission. You also must have a valid driver’s license issued in the state where you live. If accepted, you’ll be expected to wear the company-provided uniform and comply with other guidelines about your appearance.</p>

    <p>As a full-time UPS employee, you will work eight or more hours each weekday (Monday through Friday). Typically, you will not work on weekends or selected holidays.</p>

    <p>UPS driver service providers are considered ambassadors to the community, to neighbors and to friends. As part of our worldwide fleet, you’ll put a face and a voice to UPS’ global initiatives with a warm smile, a friendly greeting and impeccable service.</p>
