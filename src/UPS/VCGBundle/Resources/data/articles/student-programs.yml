    <h1>Earn up to $25,000 for your college education</h1>

    <h2>The UPS Education Assistance program helps U.S. veterans who are students obtain their degree while also receiving a paycheck.</h2>
    
    <p>Not every U.S. veteran has sufficient GI Bill benefits available to continue their education. Some decide to use their benefits in another way. That shouldn’t mean they can’t attain their dreams. When you’re a part-time employee at UPS, you are eligible to apply for up to $5,250 in assistance per calendar year, with a lifetime maximum of $25,000. That money, plus the pay you receive from working at UPS, can contribute in a significant way to your college education.</p>
    
    <p>You should also know that most UPS employees start their careers at the company as part-time workers. The company’s strong commitment to promoting from within means we’re constantly training today’s part-time employees to become tomorrow’s executives. To that end, UPS also invests about $600 million a year on training programs to help employees further their careers within the company. Tens of thousands of full-time employees started their careers as part-time employees, and a significant number of UPS managers got their start working part time.</p>
    
    <p>So if you’re a U.S. veteran in school or planning on attending college, a part-time position at UPS can be the perfect choice for right now, and a great first step for your postmilitary future. These Education Assistance program benefits are available at most UPS facilities located throughout the U.S. </p>
