    <h1>Help Wanted:<br />UPS Driver Service Provider</h1>
    
    <h2>As a driver service provider, you’ll be an important part of our worldwide fleet, putting a face and a voice to UPS. You’ll interact with our customers with a warm smile, a friendly greeting and, of course, impeccable service.</h2>

    <p>This is a physical, fast-paced, outdoor position that involves continually lifting, lowering and carrying packages that typically weigh 25–35 pounds and may weigh up to 70 pounds. </p>
    
    <p>Are you up for this challenge? You’ll need to pass a Department of Transportation (DOT) physical exam and be an excellent operator of standard (manual) transmission vehicles. We’ll test you on that. You must have a valid driver’s license issued in the state where you live. As a customer-facing member of the UPS team, you’ll be expected to comply with UPS appearance guidelines and wear the company-provided uniform. As a full-time UPS employee, you’ll work eight or more hours Monday through Friday. Typically, you will not work on weekends or selected holidays.</p>
    
    <p>UPS is proud to have the opportunity to hire our country’s military veterans. UPS has twice received the Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award for our continued support for the Guard and Reserve. Ask us about the UPS Registered Apprenticeship program, which may allow you to receive GI Bill benefits as you train in the position of driver service provider. Your GI Bill stipend would be in addition to your UPS earnings.</p>
