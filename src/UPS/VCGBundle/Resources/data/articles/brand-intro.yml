    <h1>Build Your Brand</h1>
    <p>This series of short articles will help you with everything from resumes to interviewing. Companies work hard to establish their brands, and you should do the same. What’s your brand? You’re a highly trained individual who has gained a special set of skills while courageously serving our country, skills that are valuable to a civilian employer. Every conversation, every exchange, every opportunity to present yourself in your job search should reinforce that brand. When employers always see you at your best, in your communications, in person and online, your chances of landing the job you really want will greatly improve. Think of these articles as your own personal branding kit.</p>
