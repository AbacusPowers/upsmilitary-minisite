                        It’s never too early to start researching career options and military benefits while you’re still a service member. The length of the hiring process will vary by the job you are seeking, but UPS recommends starting your search about six to nine months before ending your military career.

                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Start by exploring the resources on this site, downloading the UPS Transition Guide App [LINK TO TRANSITION APP], and preparing career search resources like your resume and cover letter. If you’re considering a move, this is the time to determine the location where you’d like to find your new career.
